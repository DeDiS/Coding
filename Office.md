Some office rules for the DeDiS-engineer team

## Communication

If somebody has headphones or another sign, don't bother him. Ask on Slack. If
you 'hide' for more than 4 hours a day, be prepared to be bothered anyway.

## Everyday tasks

### Reading

It is necessary to do at least 30' of reading. This may include papers, books or
relevant articles. Sites like Slashdot and CNN don't count.

### Code-review

As reading, it is a regular must. 15' per day, chose any projet in the dedis-
github repositories, start with Ready4Merge.
