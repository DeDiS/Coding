# Office

Some office rules for the DeDiS-engineer team

## Communication

First thing in the morning, when everybody arrived, short discussion of what we
did and what we'll be doing during the day.

If somebody has headphones or another sign, don't bother him. Ask on Slack. If
you 'hide' for more than 4 hours a day, be prepared to be bothered anyway.

No phone-calls in the office, except the official EPFL-Jabber.

## Everyday tasks

### Reading

It is necessary to do at least 30' of reading. This may include papers, books or
relevant articles. Sites like Slashdot and CNN don't count.

### Code-review

As reading, it is a regular must. 15' per day, chose any projet in the dedis-
github repositories, start with Ready4Merge.
